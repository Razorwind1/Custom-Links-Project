    <h2>Why Link Tailor?</h2>
    <p>LinkTailor was inspired by the desire to have a better link managing solution, one which allowed for easy adding of links to a spatially organized and customizable layout. The team behind LinkTailor did research on current solutions available (mostly web-link bookmark solutions) including Tagpacker, Pocket, Dragdis, Dewey bookmarks, Dropmark, Station, and <a hre="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RocketDock">RocketDock</a> and found all of them to be lacking to some degree in functionality and ease of use. However, one solution for bookmarks specifically stood out as a strong option for users looking for something more powerful than the browser’s default bookmarking system — <a hre="https://raindrop.io/">Raindrop.io</a> — which we recommend users take a look at if they are seeking a purely web-link based solution.</p>
    <p>When it comes to application management, OS solutions like the Windows Start Menu provide impressive functionality which we acknowledge LinkTailor will not match. However these solutions also have their own limitations, largely in restrictions to organization and customization, which LinkTailor is able to overcome. Thus we see LinkTailor is a solution many users will choose to use alongside other linking solutions such as browser bookmarks and the Windows Start Menu, utilizing the uniqueness of LinkTailor’s multiple arrangements, grid layout, and mass-opening groups of links.</p>

    <h2>Where Next?</h2>
<p>We are continuing to improve and develop the LinkTailor Application. Check out our GitHub Kanban to see what we have been working on: <a href="https://github.com/Razorwind1/Custom-Links-Project/projects/1">Kanban Board</a></p>

    <p>The LinkTailor team would like this app to continue to flourish with new updates! We adhere to the following when it comes to prioritizing work and design choices:</p>
    <div class="designValueBlock"><div>Functionality</div>Valuable options for users  ·  we have ideas and would love to hear more from users</div>
    <div class="designValueBlock">Convenience<div>Quick to use  ·  Measured by A) how little users have to change or think about for the app to be useful and B) how many keypresses/clicks it takes to perform frequent actions  ·  This may entail creating browser extensions and OS-integrations</div></div>
    <div class="designValueBlock"><div>Aesthetics</div>The app looks good  ·  Measured by design principles and user testing</div>
    <div class="designValueBlock"><div>Guidance</div>Helps build good workflow habits  ·  Measured by the degree of increased productivity and satisfaction users’ experience in the areas of time management and organization, particularly with regards to enjoying new schemas  ·  This may entail creating default suggestions for arrangements and tags or perhaps guiding users with prompts, helps, or guides</div>
    <div class="designValueBlock"><div>Freedom</div>Users are able to customize their experience  ·  Measured by ability to change the look and feel of their arrangements and links</div>
    <div class="designValueBlock"><div>Sharing</div>The sharing of layouts and themes between users  ·  Measured by number of users who benefit from sharing  ·  Will require easy importing/exporting of user layouts  ·  May be facilitated by online community forums or layout-sharing sites</div>
