    <h2>Why Link Tailor?</h2>
    <p>LinkTailor was inspired by the desire to have a better link managing solution, one which allowed for easy adding of links to a spatially organized and customizable layout. The team behind LinkTailor did research on current solutions available (mostly web-link bookmark solutions) including Tagpacker, Pocket, Dragdis, Dewey bookmarks, Dropmark, Station, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RocketDock">RocketDock</a> and found all of them to be lacking to some degree in functionality and ease of use. However, one solution for bookmarks specifically stood out as a strong option for users looking for something more powerful than the browser’s default bookmarking system — <a href="https://raindrop.io/">Raindrop.io</a> — which we recommend users take a look at if they are seeking a purely web-link based solution.</p>
    <p>When it comes to application management, OS solutions like the Windows Start Menu provide impressive functionality which we acknowledge LinkTailor will not match. However these solutions also have their own limitations, largely in restrictions to organization and customization, which LinkTailor is able to overcome. Thus we see LinkTailor is a solution many users will choose to use alongside other linking solutions such as browser bookmarks and the Windows Start Menu, utilizing the uniqueness of LinkTailor’s multiple arrangements, grid layout, and mass-opening groups of links.</p>

    <h2>Where Next?</h2>
<p>We are continuing to improve and develop the LinkTailor Application. Check out our GitHub Kanban to see what we have been working on: <a href="https://github.com/Razorwind1/Custom-Links-Project/projects/1">Kanban Board</a></p>
